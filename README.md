#### Alamofire https://cocoapods.org/pods/Alamofire
Alamofire is an HTTP networking library written in Swift. All networking has been handled by the Alamofire library.

#### CryptoSwift https://github.com/krzyzanowskim/CryptoSwift

### Additional Notes
1. You cannot test the QRCode Scanner and Backup Account Retrieval Feature without an Apple Developer Account
2. You have to use either an Emulator/ your personal device to test the app. If you want to test-deploy it on someone else's device, you would need the Apple Developer Account.
